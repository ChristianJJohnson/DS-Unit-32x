# Assignment
Reproduce (debugging as needed) the live lecture task of setting up and inserting the RPG data into a MongoDB instance, and add the code you write to do so here. Then answer the following question (can be a comment in the top of your code or in Markdown) - "How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?"

- Mongo DB is less structured and seems to be easier to work with if you had a large amount of data that isn't so concerned about the schema

There is no other required tasks to turn in, but it is suggested to then revisit the first two modules, rework/complete things as needed, and just check out with fresh eyes the SQL approach. Compare and contrast, and come with questions tomorrow - the main topic will be database differences and tradeoffs!

# Resources and Stretch Goals
Put Titanic data in Big Data! That is, try to load titanic.csv from yesterday into your MongoDB cluster.

Push MongoDB - it is flexible and can support fast iteration. Design your own database to save some key/value pairs for an application you'd like to work on or data you'd like to analyze, and build it out as much as you can!
